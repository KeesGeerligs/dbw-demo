Track 1: BGA Hackathon Bounty â€“ Cybersecurity & Compliance for Public Good
In the wake of high-profile cybersecurity breachesâ€”including the recent Bybit hackâ€”the need for proactive, blockchain-native threat detection is greater than ever. In response, the BGA sponsors this special track at the Block & Order: AI-Agents for Compliance Hackathon, inviting builders to create AI-powered blockchain compliance tools that target real-world, high-risk vulnerabilities in Web3 ecosystems.
ðŸŽ¯ The Challenge:
Build a prototype for an AI-agent-based blockchain security solution that can:
Identify and alert on-chain activity involving known scammer addresses or wallets linked through common patterns (e.g., chain-hopping, mixers, sudden token transfers).


Perform predictive network analysis to classify wallet addresses based on behavioral risk patternsâ€”e.g., excessive token minting, dump cycles, rug pulls.
We encourage participants to work with known open datasets (e.g., Chainalysis alerts, Etherscan tags, ScamSniffer reports) and build tools that can surface suspicious transactions before major harm occurs. For this hackathon, a working prototype is all that is needed to showcase the features and how it works. 
ðŸ§  Focus Areas (pick one or both):

Agent-Based Scam Detection


Develop a lightweight on-chain AI agent that continuously scans activity and alerts the user when interacting with potentially fraudulent addresses based on existing scam databases and network indicators.


Predictive Risk Classifier for Wallets


Design a network analysis model (with optional AI enhancements) that can analyze wallet behavior and assign risk scores to addresses in real-time, enabling developers, exchanges, and users to avoid malicious actors.
ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters:
The blockchain industry continues to suffer from reputational damage due to fraud and scams. A security layer powered by AI agents, integrated natively with blockchains, can democratize trust and restore user confidenceâ€”especially in high-risk regions or use cases like DeFi, NFT trading, and peer-to-peer transfers.
ðŸ§¾ Definitions:


Suspicious Transactions:
 Transactions that exhibit patterns such as rapid large-volume transfers, interactions with flagged addresses, token honeypots, or significant deviation from historical behavior.


Known Scammer Patterns:
 Wallets involved in phishing campaigns, bridge exploits, token approval drainers, or laundering via mixers. Datasets may include sources like Chainabuse, De.Fi, SlowMist, and Etherscanâ€™s tags.
